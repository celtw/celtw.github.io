  <h3>Invited speakers</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Claudia Soria</strong> is a researcher at CNR-ILC. She has a background in computational linguistics, with a focus on language resources in their entire life-cycle, from creation to representation to evaluation. She is one of the authors of LMF, Lexical Markup Framework, an ISO standard for the representation of computational lexicons. Her current research interests revolve around use of technological means, Language Technology in particular, for protection and valorisation of linguistic diversity. Other current interests are use and usability of regional/minority languages on social media; ethnolinguistic vitality of regional and minority languages of Italy; creation of lexico-conceptual resources for archiving traditional knowledge. She coordinated an Erasmus+ project, “The Digital Language Diversity Project”, and a research project in cooperation with the Polish Academy of Sciences, “Protection of the linguistic heritage. A comparison of attitudes towards linguistic diversity in Poland and Italy”. She’s currently serving as vice-director of the European Language Equality Network (ELEN), and is part of the UNESCO Board of Experts on Multilingualism in Cyberspace. On the activist side, she is involved in spreading awareness about Italy's linguistic diversity, encouraging use and re-appropriation of autochthonous languages.</p>
  <p><strong>Kelly Davis</strong> has many irons in the fire. He studied Mathematics and Physics at MIT, then went on to do graduate work in Superstring Theory/M-Theory. He then jumped ship, coding at a startup that eventually went public in the late 90's. When the bubble burst, he jumped back into an academic setting and joined the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics where he worked on software systems used to help simulate black hole mergers. Jumping ship yet again, he went back into industry, writing 3D rendering software at Mental Images/NVIDIA. When that lost its charm, he founded a NLU at a startup, 42, that created a system, based off of IBM'S Watson, able to answer general knowledge questions. After a brief stint as the Director of Machine Learning at another Berlin startup, he joined Mozilla where he now leads the machine learning group.</p>

<h3>Call for papers</h3>

<p>Language Technology and Computational Linguistics research innovations in
recent years have given us a great deal of modern language processing tools
and resources for many languages. Basic language tools like spell and
grammar checkers through to interactive systems like Siri, as well as
resources like the Trillion Word Corpus, all fit together to produce
products and services which enhance our daily lives.</p>

<p>Until relatively recently, languages with smaller numbers of speakers have
largely not benefited from attention in this field. However, modern
techniques in the field are making it easier to create language tools and
resources from fewer resources in a faster time. In this light, many lesser-spoken languages are making their way into the digital age through the
provision of language technologies and resources.</p>

<p>The Celtic Language Technology Workshop (CLTW) series of workshops provides
a forum for researchers interested in developing NLP (Natural Language
Processing) resources and technologies for Celtic languages. As Celtic
languages are under-resourced, our goal is to encourage collaboration and
communication between researchers working on language technologies and
resources for Celtic languages.</p>

<p>This will be the third Celtic Language Technology Workshop (CLTW), this
time co-located with MT Summit XVII in Dublin, Ireland.</p>

<p>Our workshop welcomes theoretical and practical submissions on any Celtic language (Irish, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Cornish or Breton) that contributes to research in machine translation, automated language processing, language/speech technologies or resources for the same. With Ireland’s recent progress in the area of machine translation (particularly in public administration) and steps towards combining speech processing and machine translation for Welsh, there is much scope for sharing best practices and leveraging from learned experiences through working with limited resources in this forum. We will particularly encourage studies that address either practical applications with a human in the loop or the lack of resources available for a given language in this field.</p>

<p>Topics of interest for the CLTW include but are not limited to:
  <ul>
    <li>machine translation</li>
    <li>corpus development and analysis</li>
    <li>treebanking</li>
    <li>speech technology</li>
    <li>evaluation methods</li>
    <li>language resources</li>
    <li>syntax</li>
    <li>semantics</li>
    <li>parsing</li>
    <li>lexicons</li>
    <li>phonology</li>
    <li>morphological analysis</li>
    <li>ontologies</li>
    <li>terminology</li>
    <li>knowledge representation</li>
    <li>computer-assisted language learning (CALL)</li>
    <li>Digital Humanities</li>
  </ul>
