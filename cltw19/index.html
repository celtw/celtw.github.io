<h2>Celtic Language Technology Workshop 2019</h2>
<h3>At MT Summit XVII, Dublin City University, Dublin</h3>
<h3>Monday 19th August 2019</h3>

<h3>Call for papers</h3>

<p>Our workshop welcomes theoretical and practical submissions on any Celtic language (Irish, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Cornish or Breton) that contributes to research in machine translation, automated language processing, language/speech technologies or resources for the same. With Irelandâ€™s recent progress in the area of machine translation (particularly in public administration) and steps towards combining speech processing and machine translation for Welsh, there is much scope for sharing best practices and leveraging from learned experiences through working with limited resources in this forum. We will particularly encourage studies that address either practical applications with a human in the loop or the lack of resources available for a given language in this field.</p>

<p>Topics of interest for the CLTW include but are not limited to: <ul>
    <li>machine translation</li>
    <li>corpus development and analysis</li>
    <li>treebanking</li>
    <li>speech technology</li>
    <li>evaluation methods</li>
    <li>language resources</li>
    <li>syntax</li>
    <li>semantics</li>
    <li>parsing</li>
    <li>lexicons</li>

    <li>morphological analysis</li>, ontologies, terminology and knowledge representation, <li>computer-assisted language learning (CALL)</li>
    <li>Digital Humanities</li>
  </ul>
